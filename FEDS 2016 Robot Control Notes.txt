>>>> NOTES <<<<
	(Shooter Wheels)
	The shooter wheels start at 8100 rpm; they are PID controlled.
	The Wheels will overshoot on rpm at first, then level to 8100 rpm after approx. 2 seconds.
	Shooting usually takes place while the wheels are over-speed. Good timing can 'aim' the ball's
	trajectory.
	
	(Drive-Train Control Mode)
	The drive train starts in PID controlled mode. Each controller has the ability to
	turn off the PID mode in favor of the more primitive direct voltage control mode.
	The PID mode is far superior at fine movements, turning, and cleanly crossing
	the defenses, however it can take away from the reaction time of the robot. Essentally
	it smoothes out the driver inputs. The driver may want to turn off PID mode to get a
	better top speed, better responsiveness, or just if the driver prefers it.
	
	(Lifter Safety)
	The lifter mechanism can tear the robot apart if used at the wrong time, or if it
	is pushed too far. Before the quick release, the pickup box _needs_ to be down or
	the lift arms catch on it. While lifting, the pickup should be closed. If the pickup 
	box is closed after lifting, it will collide with the closed arms.
	*** However, the operator shouldn't need be worried about these steps too much. If forgotten, 
	the code will drop the pickup automatically instead of quick releasing the lifter on the first
	press. Also, as soon as the lifter arms begin to close, the code will automatically lift the
	pickup box.
